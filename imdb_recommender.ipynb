For example, the show \"Gilmore Girls\" is about a girl and her mom.  The TV show \"The Exercist\" also deals with a mom and her daughter.  The TF-IDF model honed in on \"daughter\" and \"mother\" and thus returned \"The Exercist\" as a recommendation.  Clearly, this is not a good recommendation.  The transformers model did not return \"The Exercist\" and seems to much better understand the context of the search show's description and give better recommendations."
