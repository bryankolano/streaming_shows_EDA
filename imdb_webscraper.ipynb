    "\n",
    "In a previous notebook, I conducted a visual exploratory data analysis to examine best and worst shows across each platform.  I thought it might be an interesting aside to have more information about each tv show and be able to perform further analysis.  I inspected IMDb's website for a few of the TV shows and saw they had short one to two sentence descriptions about each show and each show had a couple of genre tags.  For example, the show \"Breaking Bad\" has the genre tags of crime, drama, and thriller.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance the streaming TV show dataset, I decided I would webscrape IMDb to collect each show's descriptions and tags and then append it to the original data."
