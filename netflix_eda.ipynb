    "The custom function worked for the purpose it served, but both DPLYR in R and Pandas in Python have functions/ methods to pivot data longer or wider, whatever is needed to make it tidy, the melt method of Pandas is used to pivot longer the data.  This produces a similar output to the custom function, but there is no longer a 'multi-platform' value.  Shows on multiple platforms are counted in each of the platforms that hosts them.   "

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "There is some interesting research that can be done by visualization and graphically inspecting the data.  One thing the data lacks is the number of years the show ran, and the years is has been hosted in a given platform.  For example, in this data, a show that debuted in 2008 might be popular in 2009 than any show that debuted in 2009.  However, when we look at top shows in 2009, we won't see that show that debuted in '08, only those that debuted in 2009.  This could be potentially confusing when visually inspecting the results and the graphics."
